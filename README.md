# UBRobotics

Dear members,

This is the UBRobotics code repository, inside you'll find our custom libraries to use and edit, as well as example Arduino sketches for them.

Navigate to the ARDUINO folder, inside you will find:

-libraries
-Prototype Code

The former contains folders of libraries you can directly import into Arduino IDE (Sketch --> Include Library --> Add .ZIP Library --> Select FOLDER).

Prototype code contains random sketches that experiment with different features of the robots.

Remember, some of the libraries have other custom libraries as requirement, check that you have them installed before you compile the code.

Happy Coding!
